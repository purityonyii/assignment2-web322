## ✅ Project Description

This is my Meal Kit web app built for Assignment #2 in WEB322.  
In this assignment, I learned how to capture form submissions, validate user data using server-side JavaScript, store passwords in an encrypted format, and set up user authentication using sessions.

I continued from Assignment #1 and added new pages, server-side validation logic, MongoDB storage, and a simple welcome email feature using MailGun.

I followed the MVC design pattern:
- Controllers handle routing
- Models handle database communication
- Views use EJS templates
- A service file sends emails
- Middleware protects routes
